## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose:

When decided to fund a project it is important to know whether the project will be successful. Throughout this analysis machine learning tools and neural network models it is possible to made determinations prior to funding. The models will help with predictions that will be used throughout the decision making process. 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
